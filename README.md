# Momentum

"Momentum" is a prescriptive management solution for Engineering Managers and Team Leads. It outlines an engaging one-on-one and status gathering script making records of adminstrative followups, issues, status and goals, stretch questions and deeper exercises like Priority Quadrants. All inputs are recorded along with third party tool integration data (jira, trello) to allow for realtime, dynamic in-app and emailed reports over any time period that greatly ease self assessment excercises during review periods.
